	A multifaceted visionary who fuses the tangible virtues of a
physician, a researcher, an innovator, an entrepreneur and a
gentleman into a unique and powerful champion for the company.
Senior clinical care and research medical professional with more than
20 years of experience in primary care, research, scholarly and
teaching activities. A challanger who pushes the boundaries; high
drive, passion and creativity - these are features that inspire his

	</p>
	
	<p class="lead">
	As a researcher, Dr. Castellanos has remained focused on the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and
associated cancers, and his two main discoveries include the identification of synthetic peptides that can
induce a cytotoxic T-cell immune response against HPV type 18 targets, and a novel method to improve the
histopathologic classification of HPV (+) cervical precancers, advancing both therapeutics and diagnostics.
	</p>
	
	<p class="lead">
	His proven track record in development and implementation of innovative solutions across a range of areas
has resulted in the award of a patent for a Histochemical Method to Identify and Predict Disease Progression of
HPV-infected Lesions, and having yet another patent in the pipeline for Activity Enhancing Curcumin
Composition and Methods of Use, as a novel treatment for HPV associated disease.
	</p>
	
	<p class="lead">
	Dr. Castellanos’ leadership in conducting important and impactful research has been proved by awarding him
multiple grants for clinical research projects. In 2009, Dr. Castellanos was appointed the Director of Research
for the Department of Medicine at Staten Island University Hospital, North Shore-LIJ Health System. He has led
initiatives to establish collaborations between scientist and physicians, accelerating laboratory advances into
the clinical setting. As a physician, Dr. Castellanos has remained very active clinically. He conducts weekly
medical continuity clinics and a medical women’s health session.

journals and was an invited presenter at more than 20 international and national conferences. His academic
activity as a faculty was recognized by his recent promotion to the position of Research Associate Professor,

notable professional societies such as The International Papillomavirus Society, European Organization Genital Infection and Neoplasia, and the American College of Physicians. Dr. Castellanos graduated from an
accelerated 7 year B.S.-M.D. Program of Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education and Albany Medical
College followed by Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship in Weill Cornell Medical College and Medical Residency

	</p>
	
	<p class="lead">
	This broad-spectrum activity has resulted in institution of INNOVENE, a company of which he is the President
and Co-founder, a company with the goal of catalyzing traditional research and developing plant based
therapeutic compounds. The company is seeking to introduce its proprietary botanical compound TriCurin in to
the cancer prevention and treatment marketplace, as the first treatment for cervical HPV infection and
associated cancers.
